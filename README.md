# Analyzing Sentiment and Content of Covid-19 Vaccine Tweets
### Classification and Summarization in Natural Language Processing

This paper reviews tweets on the topic of Covid-19 vaccines in terms of sentiment and content. The goals of sentiment classification and text summarization in the form of sentence extraction and text generation
are addressed. A better understanding of the models best suited for identifying and understanding large bodies of fragmented texts is hoped to be achieved.
Among the Na¨ıve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, the latter two, which are discriminative models, were discovered to be most suitable for classifying the sentiment of tweets. As a
continuation, an LSTM model is used to attempt text generation. However, sentence extraction is found to be better suited in this scenario for providing a simple overview of ideas prevalent within the Tweets. 
Therefore, we recommend discriminative models for classification problems, and sentence extraction as a sufficient way of obtaining a summary in this case.
